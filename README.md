refNum Element Set (plugin for Omeka)
=====================================


Summary
-------

This plugin creates a file element set for the refNum standard and adds the
metadata that can't be replaced by a Dublin Core element.

[refNum][1] is an xml format dedicated to digital and scanned images,
especially from books and manuscripts but not only. This standard has been
created by [Bibliothèque nationale de France][2], the French national library.

**Note**: refNum standard is not totally implemented: only items useful for
École des Ponts are added.

For more information on Omeka, see [Omeka][3].


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "RefnumElementSet".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin. The plugin has no configuration.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It's always recommended to backup your database so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on [GitHub][4].
